# <a name="1"/>1 Project Framework
Test 1

## <a name="1.1"/>1.1 Abstract
The project is as follows : the idea is to create a 3D snake
## <a name="1.1"/>1.2 Challenges and objectives
## <a name="1.1"/>1.3 Final report
## <a name="1.1"/>1.4 Team presentation
To complete this project I would be alone but I would be supervised by Dr. Mark Humphrys. Mr Humphrys is a professor at DCU but also a researcher, he has a PhD from Cambridge. He works at DCU's computer lab, here is his [email address]() and his [twitter](https://twitter.com/markhumphrys).

# <a name="2"/>1 Different stages
## <a name="2.1"/>2.1 Stage 1
The first stage would be to realize a snake in three dimensions and make it playable by a human.
## <a name="2.2"/>2.2 Stage 2
The second stage would be to add random blocks in the canvas to create a more difficult world.
## <a name="2.3"/>2.3 Stage 3
The third step would be to add a peripheral vision to the snake so that it looks like a real snake, a bigger peripheral vision at the level of its head and a meager vision all along its tail.
## <a name="2.4"/>2.4 Stage 4
The fourth stage would be to remove the knowledge of the location of food to the snake. He would know the location of the food only when he saw it in his field of view.
## <a name="2.5"/>2.5 Stage 5
The fifth stage would be to focus on the study of different artificial intelligence arhitectures to choose the most suitable for my problem.
## <a name="2.6"/>2.6 Stage 6
The sixth stage would be, after having chosen the architecture of my neural network, to start the implementation of this neural network and its genetic algorithm.

# <a name="3"/>1 Technical specification
## <a name="3.1"/>1.1 Langage
The informatic langage is imposed by Mr Humphrys, it will be JavaScript like that he will be able to host easily my project on his [website](https://ancientbrain.com/)
## <a name="3.2"/>1.1 Framework
My choice for the project framework is tensorflow.js because it is one of most well documented AI framework. It also has a very active community so it could be very usefull.
